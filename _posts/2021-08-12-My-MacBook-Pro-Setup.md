## Restoring my MacBook

I recently ran out of free space on my MacBook Pro. I used it mainly before Covid-19 to code on the go. Unfortunately, coding is one area where the iPad still cannot replace a MacBook. Ever since Covid came around, I rarely used the MacBook. In hopes of returning to the university campus sooner rather than later, I completely wiped the machine. I directly put Monterey on it because it is stable enough to use it for most stuff. The only thing that is still crashing for me is VirtualBox.

## The Basics

For the most part, I do not change most of the default settings. There are some areas where I differ from the baked-in options. The first setting I immediately deactivate is in the general section. "Allow wallpaper tinting in windows" looks good. But I do find it distracting when working with many windows from different apps. I keep my appearance on light mode because the automatic option uses the night shift schedule. Unlike on iOS, there is no individual option, but there is an app for that ;)
![General Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2020.58.37.jpeg)
Next, I changed the screen saver to the new "Hello" screen saver that debuted with the new iMacs and is now available for everyone in Monterey. It looks visually appealing and is by far my favorite screen saver right now. I also reduced the starting time from 20 minutes to 5. Otherwise, the MacBooks screen would turn off before the screensaver even starts.
![Desktop & Screen Saver Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2020.59.47.jpeg)
After that, I turned off "Show recent applications in Dock" because it fills the dock with up to three more icons which I possibly do not even need. I like my dock to be as clean and minimal as possible. I do not put the dock to the left side of the display. I also do not automatically hide it. I tried it a couple of years ago, but I find it more convenient for the dock to be at the bottom always accessible.
![Dock & Menu Bar Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2021.02.05.jpeg)
Apple introduced the new focus feature in iOS 15. Part of what makes this feature so great is that it works across all Apple devices, and it's syncing with iCloud. With this change in mind, I decided to enable "always" to show the focus icon in the menu bar, even if no focus mode is activated. That change makes it easy to set a focus mode with just a click. Without that setting, the user has to go to the control center first. My next blog post is all about the new focus feature and how I use it. So stay tuned for that.
![Dock & Menu Bar Focus Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2021.02.58.jpeg)
I also decided to add the display icon to the menu bar. That makes it easy to initiate Sidecar on my iPad. With just a click, my iPad becomes a second display for my MacBook.
![Dock & Menu Bar Display Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2021.04.51.jpeg)
Ever since I discovered Raycast, I ditched the spotlight feature completely. In recent years Spotlight has become much better, but it misses some key features for me.
![Dock & Menu Bar Spotlight Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2021.06.43.jpeg)
I rarely use Siri on the Mac. Siri seems just inefficient for most tasks in macOS. Removing the icon from the menu bar saves a bit of space.
![Dock & Menu Bar Siri Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2021.07.25.jpeg)
Next, I checked if my focus settings are correct. They were, and the screenshot provides a glimpse of what I currently have set up. Right now, I am adding a few more focus modes. Also, I am customizing the home pages on all my devices to correspond to a specific focus setting.
![Notifications Focus Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2021.08.14.jpeg)
Even though my MacBook has Touch ID, I still enable the Apple Watch unlocking feature. Nine out of ten times, my MacBook unlocks itself without me lifting a finger.
![Security & Privacy Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2021.09.32.jpeg)
A little trick most Mac users do not know about is that the fn key can be set to display the Emoji Picker. A must-have setting to turn on if you use messaging services on your Mac.
![Keyboard Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2021.10.45.jpeg)
I disable True Tone on all my devices. When True Tone launched with the 9.7 iPad Pro in 2016, I used to love the feature. Ever since I got glasses, it looks worse for me. I also do not bother setting up Night Shift because I use f.lux.
![Display Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2021.11.18.jpeg)
Since I am still on an Intel-based MacBook, the battery life is not amazing. New in Monterey is the "low power mode" feature. I decided to have it automatically turn on when my MacBook is not plugged in. The performance is reduced, but I also notice better battery life and less heat. This trade-off is worth it for me when on the go.
![Battery Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2021.12.28.jpeg)
Next, I installed the Homebrew package manager. Installing and updating programs and tools from the command line is incredibly useful. It depends on Xcodes Comand Line Tools and installs them.
![Terminal Homebrew Installation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2021.14.57.jpeg)
I prefer iTerm 2, a terminal replacement that is more customizable and provides more power-user features, which I sometimes need. While browsing through [iTerm2colorschemes](https://iterm2colorschemes.com), I noticed that one annoying setting is still turned on. I immediately turned off "open 'safe' files after downloading. For example, mp3 files would otherwise automatically import themselves into the music library and autoplay.
![Safari Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2021.28.35.jpeg)
My favorite iTerm design right now is "3024", with the minimal theme turned on.
![Terminal iTerm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2021.30.15.jpeg)
After installing Raycast, I disabled the keyboard shortcuts to access Spotlight. I use the normal cmd + space to launch Raycast.
![Keyboard Shortcuts Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2021.35.13.jpeg)

## Third-Party Apps

As mentioned earlier, I use Raycast. It is highly customizable and has great extensions built-in. For example, a window management tool that accepts the same keyboard shortcuts as Magnet to snap windows into place. Also great is it's GitHub and Zoom support and the ability to quickly view the schedule on your calendar.
![Raycast Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2021.36.56.jpeg)
I like to keep my Apple devices for many years. The only real limiting factor is the aging of the battery. The app "Aldente" lets me chose a percentage at which the MacBook stops charging. I chose 80%. Having the MacBook plugged in at 80% is better than at 100% for longer periods of time.
![Aldente Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2021.40.12.jpeg)
The next app is one of my all-time favorites. I have been using the app for over ten years now, and I still love it. It shifts the colors of the display in the evening to much warmer ones. The display looks "Yellow". It helps with eyestrain when staying up late and helps me sleep better. Nowadays, all modern operating systems, both mobile and desktop, have this function built-in, but this app makes the display even warmer.
![f.lux Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2021.42.43.jpeg)
Next, I installed my favorite Firefox theme. I use Safari for basically everything but watch twitch in Firefox because of BetterTwitchTV.
![Firefox Theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2021.46.10.jpeg)
BetterTwitchTV provides extra emotes, both still and animated, for every participating channel.
![BetterTwitchTV AddOn](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2021.47.00.jpeg)
I also installed an ad-blocker. I don't mind watching ads before a stream starts, but having an ad play while something interesting happens is infuriating.
![Video Ad-Blocker For Twitch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2021.48.17.jpeg)
Shifting back to must-have apps. I mentioned earlier that I kept the system in light mode. Nightowl allows me to set a custom schedule for dark mode.
![Nightowl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2021.50.03.jpeg)
Next, I installed Zoom (for now) because everything at my university happens there. I really cannot wait to return to in-person lectures again.
![Zoom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2021.52.53.jpeg)
I recently discovered "Xcodes". There is both a version for the command line and one with a graphical user interface (the one I am using). It downloads, unzips, and drags Xcode, Apple's IDE, into the programs folder with just a click.
![Xcodes App Graphical User Interface](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2021.53.52.jpeg)
My favorite markdown tool is "MacDown". It is super easy to use and has a preview pane on the right-hand side. Recently I started writing markdown in Visual Studio Code on my iMac. The GitHub integration is great. Maybe I am switching to it on the MacBook too, but for now, MacDown is great.
![MacDown App](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2021.58.01.jpeg)
One tool that I love is "Zotero". It helps me to organize scientific papers for writing assignments.
![Zotero App](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2021.59.52.jpeg)
KeyboardCleanTool is awesome. It disables the keyboard when clicking start to avoid unintentional keystrokes while cleaning my keyboard.
![KeyboardCleanTool App](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2022.18.59.jpeg)

## App Store Apps

Goodnotes is an awesome companion app on the Mac for the iPad version. My notes get synced across devices over iCloud and are easily accessible on all my devices.
![GoodNotes 5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2022.13.08.jpeg)
Grammarly is a powerful app that helps me identify both grammatical and spelling errors. I highly recommend it.
![Grammarly App](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2022.13.58.jpeg)
Honey is a great Safari extension that lets me save money on check out. A few weeks ago, I saved 5 Euros with just a click.
![Honey App](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2022.14.52.jpeg)
Sometimes I use Notability. The companion app does the same as the GoodNotes one. It syncs my notes.
![Notability App](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2022.15.17.jpeg)
Before Covid-19, I used to go to Starbucks to study there. Sometimes a cool song would play that I did not know before. With Shazam, I could just click the icon in the menu bar to identify the song. Here is to hoping that I get to do this again soon.
![Shazam](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2022.15.49.jpeg)
Telegram has a bad reputation here in Germany because a lot of misinformation and conspiracies are shared there. At my university, we use the app to collab and send funny stickers to one another.
![Telegram App](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2022.16.30.jpeg)
I pay for TickTick because I love the "habits" feature. It also has a Pomodoro timer and a comprehensive to-do list.
![TickTick App](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2022.17.13.jpeg)
Tweetbot is also an app well worth the money. It lets me see tweets chronologically, and it syncs my timeline position across devices. Most of the time, I do not want to see what people I followed have liked. I only want to see their tweets.
![Tweetbot3 App](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikipe/Nikipe.github.io/main/pictures/2021-08-12-My-MacBook-Pro-Setup/Screenshot%202021-07-31%20at%2022.17.51.jpeg)

### Almost done

These are all the apps and tools that I have installed on my MacBook for now. I am sure that more will be added once I start using it more whenever in-person lectures will resume in the future.
My next blog post is all about the *focus feature* and how I use it.
